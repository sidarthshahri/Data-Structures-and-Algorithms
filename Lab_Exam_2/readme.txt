Lab Exam 2

Singly Linked List: Complete the following
1. Make a class called 'simple' that has two members. One for a number and one for a letter
2. Make a singly linked list by reading from fileA. Each node should contain a 'simple' object
3. Mak e singly linked list by reading from fileB.
4. Make a print function that will display a linked list in the following format:
                H->1A->2A->3A->4A->5A->...->8A->9A->10A->N
5. Print list A and list B onto the console
5. Merge the two list into one single linked list
6. Print the merged list
   The list should look like this: H->1A->2A->...->9A->10A->1B->2B->...->9B->10B->N
   
BONUS:
Merge the list according to the number and letter member of 'simple'. Meaning that your final merged list
should look like this: H->1A->1B->2A->2B->...->9A->9B->10A->10B->N

If this bonus is fully completed, I will give you full credit on any previous lab of your choosing as long as
you have a submission for it. If you have full points on your labs, then I will add up to 5 points to lab exam 1,
but I will not award more than 100% on an assignment.
