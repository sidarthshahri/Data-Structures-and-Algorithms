Directions:
1) Create an array of 10 stacks
2) Create an array of integers
3) Make a for loop that loops 3 times
      - 1st iteration: look at 1's place and push to appropriate stack
      for s[0] to s[9] pop values back into array
      - 2nd iteration: repeat with 10's place
      - 3rd iteration: repeat with 100's place

 Answer Questions:
 1) What did I just make you do?
 2) How is this algorithm different? (Only works if you used an array of queues)
 3) Can you solve this using a queue?
 4) What is the complexity?
